# Tunes Beyond Border: 
## Exploring Music Taste Similarities on Spotify Across Regions

### About
This project seeks to explore and compare Spotifyâ€™s local and global charts to uncover patterns and differences in music preferences across regions. The motivation behind this study stems from the intriguing interplay between language and music preferences. People from different regions often prefer to songs in their native languages, reflecting the cultural and emotional connections fostered by familiar lyrics and melodies. However, music also has the potential to cross language barriers, with global hits resonating in regions far from the language of the lyrics. This duality raises fascinating questions: What drives the global appeal of certain songs? How similar or distinct are the musical preferences of listeners across regions?

By examining these questions, we aim to uncover the extent of overlap in music tastes across regions and identify opportunities for cross-cultural music recommendations. Understanding these patterns could pave the way for innovative strategies, such as recommending music from one region to listeners in another, even if they are unfamiliar with the language. Such recommendations could enrich listening experiences, foster cultural exchange, and create a more interconnected global music community.
